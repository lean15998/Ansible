 # 2. Cài đặt
 
 ### Trên node `host01` và `host02`
 
 - Cài đặt ssh

```sh
root@host01:~# apt install ssh -y
```

- Tạo ssh-keygen

```sh
root@host01:~# ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:7Tlip7X0Y/7bWTv3G8iqsny9rX5RIe2p0eqC+SlrAe0 root@host01
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|              .  |
|             . o |
|        .     + o|
|       . o   . = |
|        S .   =  |
|         E ..+.  |
|        o % .o...|
|      .o % **o o*|
|       o*oBXB+o=B|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
 
 
 ### Trên node controller
 
 - Cài đặt ansible và ssh

```sh
root@quynv:~# apt install ssh ansible -y
```

- Copy key ssh

```sh
root@quynv:~# ssh-copy-id root@10.0.0.53
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host '10.0.0.53 (10.0.0.53)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:cdWjSlIbJ6wEnkgbPiCiVNsJYbX+90/QHu+ycji3SsY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@10.0.0.53's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@10.0.0.53'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

- Khai báo file inventory

 ```sh
 root@quynv:~# vim /etc/ansible/hosts 

[node]
node02 ansible_host=10.0.0.53 ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root
node01 ansible_host=10.0.0.51 ansible_port=22 ansible_user=root
```

- Liệt kê danh sách host đã khai báo

```sh
root@quynv:~# ansible all --list-hosts
  hosts (2):
    node02
    node01
```
